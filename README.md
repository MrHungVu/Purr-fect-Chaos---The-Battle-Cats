## Problem

### Challenges in the Current Blockchain Gaming Market

1. **Lack of Genuine Gaming Experience**

   - **Pump and Dump Games, GameFi Lacking Depth:**
     - Many current web3 games operate on a "pump and dump" model, where players expect to invest a small amount and receive returns of 10x or 100x without actually engaging in gameplay.
     - Gameplay is monotonous, requiring only auto-clicking, lacking entertainment and player engagement.
     - This leads to a rapid decline in community and game ecosystem sustainability.

   - **System Exploitation Through Multiple Accounts and Auto Scripts:**
     - Players create hundreds of accounts and use scripts to receive airdrops without genuine participation.
     - Diminishes community quality, making it difficult to build a sustainable ecosystem.

2. **Lack of Focus on Player Experience and Social Connectivity**

   - **Games Lacking Real Entertainment Value:**
     - Unengaging gameplay fails to motivate exploration and enjoyment.
   - **Limited Social Interaction:**
     - Lacks features that encourage sharing, competition, or cooperation among players.
     - Fails to create a strong and vibrant community.

3. **High Entry Barriers and Technological Complexity**

   - **Technological Challenges:**
     - Requires players to have knowledge of wallets, tokens, NFTs, and other technical concepts.
     - Creates a significant barrier for new players, limiting widespread adoption of blockchain technology in gaming.

## Solution

### Unique and Engaging Gameplay

- **4-Day Game Rounds:**

  - **Easy Participation:**
    - Players invest a small amount to join a 4-day game round.
    - This amount (after a small fee for the developer) is added to a transparent **common pool** on the blockchain.

  - **Fair Reward Distribution:**
    - The entire pool is distributed to players based on the final leaderboard.
    - Players can earn back their investment by actively participating and forming alliances.

- **Spin to Perform Actions:**

  - **Daily Free Spins:**
    - Each day, players have **5 free spins**, which can result in one of **three main actions**:

      1. **Protective Shield:**
         - **Effect:**
           - Protects your cat from opponents' attacks for a certain period or number of attacks.
         - **Strategy:**
           - Use when your cat is at a high level or you anticipate being attacked.

      2. **Throw "Mud" at Opponents:**
         - **Effect:**
           - Reduces the HP of an opponent's cat.
           - Each successful throw grants **1 experience point (EXP)**.
         - **Strategy:**
           - Attack strong opponents to lower their ranking.
           - Retaliate against those who have attacked you.

      3. **Clean (Restore):**
         - **Effect:**
           - Restores HP to your own cat or another player's cat.

  - Funds from additional spins also go into the **common pool**, with only a small fee taken by the developer.
  - **The more competitive or "salty" the players become**, the more they might spend on additional spins, increasing the game's revenue.

### Cat Upgrade Mechanism

- **Encourages Cooperation and Social Interaction:**
  - Players form **alliances** to clean each other's cats and level up faster.
  - Creates an environment where players must **strategize** between attacking and cooperating.

### Transparent and Fair Economic System
